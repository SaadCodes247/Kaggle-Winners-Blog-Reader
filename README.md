# Situation!
### I wanted to learn as much as possible about succeeding in Kaggle competitions, so I found a dataset on Kaggle with 182 post-competition winner interview blogs!

# The Problem:
### However, the problem I had was that the entire webpage content of each interview was badly formatted into a single cell of the spreadsheet for every single interview! It was a real mess!

# The Solution
### At first, I was just copying and pasting each interview into an online HTML viewer, which was incredibly slow and inefficient. That's when I thought, hold on, I've learned data analysis and NLP from my Digital Futures Data Analyst course. I have the knowledge to do something about this!

# The Result?
### I took the initiative to solve this real problem I was facing while giving myself a chance to learn Flask for the first time. As a previous user of REACT, it gave me a great insight into how Python handles web development, and best of all, you too can now see all the 182 interviews on one page! Thus, I learned a new tool and solved a problem at the same time!

# Wish to read the winning interviews too?
- Just pip install flask and run the app!
